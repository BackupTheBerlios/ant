In order to compile ant you need:

 o OCaml version 3.08,
 o kpathsea version 3.2,
 o FreeType version 2,
 o mlgmp version 20021123,
 o CamlImages version 2.2.

(1) You might want to edit `Config.mk'. In particular, the variables
KPATHSEA_LFLAGS and KPATHSEA_CFLAGS probably need adjustment.

(2) Type

  $ make depend
  $ make

To speed up the compilation you can create a native version of the
preprocessor camlp4 by typing

  $ make depend NATIVE_CAMLP4=1
  $ make NATIVE_CAMLP4=1

instead, or you can uncomment the corresponding line in `Config.mk'. If you
prefer to compile to bytecode instead of native code use

  $ make NATIVE=

By default the makefile will use the native compilers. If these are
unsupported use

  $ make OPT=

Further documentation can be found in the file `manual.ps', the
directory `Examples' contains some example ant sources including the
source of the manual.
