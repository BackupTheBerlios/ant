In order to compile ant you need:

 o OCaml version 3.08 (version 3.09.0 is buggy and does not work),
 o kpathsea version 3.2,
 o FreeType version 2,
 o CamlImages version 2.2,
 o mlgmp version 20021123 (optional).

(1) You might want to edit the file “Config.mk” to set some paths. In
particular, the variables KPATHSEA_LDFLAGS and KPATHSEA_CFLAGS probably
need adjustment.

(2) You can choose between three number libraries:

 o Float: (default) All computations use floating point numbers. This is
          the fastes option but it might result in rounding errors.
 o Gmp:   uses the mlgmp library. This gives exact results but it
          slower.
 o Num:   Is similar to Gmp but does not depend on an external library.
          This is the slowest option.

You can specify the number library by setting the NUM_LIB variable in
the file “Config.mk”. Alternatively you can pass the corresponding
option directly to make, like:

  $ make NUM_LIB=Gmp

(3) You can specify which version of the compiler to use by setting the
following variables:

 o NATIVE: If empty ant is compiled to bytecode. Otherwise, native code
   is produced (default).
 o NATIVE_CAMLP4: If nonempty a native version of the preprocessor
   camlp4 is created. This speeds up the compilation process.
 o OPT: Determines whether to use the bytecode version of the compilers
   (OPT="") or the native version (OPT=".opt").

(4) Finally, to compile ant type

  $ make depend
  $ make

(5) Further documentation can be found in the file “manual.pdf”. The
directory “Examples” contains some example ant sources including the
source of the manual.
